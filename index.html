            <img src="image/cbsAbacha.jpg" alt="Abacha Musa" alt="About Abacha Musa">
            
            <p>
                My name is Abacha, and I am an entry-level security analyst. I am driven and passionate 
                about safeguarding people‚Äôs security, including their financial well-being. I enjoy working 
                with technology, analyzing complex problems, and finding effective solutions.
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong class="slide-in">The main reason I chose to pursue a career in cybersecurity </strong><br>
                is my passion for technology and the need to protect what I build as a software developer. 
                I am also a full-stack developer with experience in creating software and developing websites to 
                promote businesses online. My interest in cybersecurity stems from a desire to ensure the confidentiality, 
                integrity, and availability of information by protecting networks, devices, people, and data from unauthorized 
                access or cyber exploitation.
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong class="slide-in">What Makes Me Unique in the Field </strong><br>
                What sets me apart is my dual expertise as both a software developer and a security analyst. My hands-on experience 
                in full-stack development gives me a deeper understanding of how systems are built, making it easier for me to 
                identify vulnerabilities and design secure solutions from the ground up. I have a natural curiosity and a 
                problem-solving mindset, which drives me to find creative solutions to complex security challenges.
            </p>

            <p>
                Additionally, I have a strong commitment to continuous learning, demonstrated by my completion of the Google 
                Cybersecurity Certificate. This program not only enhanced my technical skills but also prepared me to approach 
                cybersecurity challenges with a professional mindset. My ability to bridge the gap between development and security, 
                combined with my passion for protecting people and their data, makes me uniquely positioned to excel¬†in¬†this¬†field.

            <p>
                In this activity, I conducted an internal security audit. 
                Audits help ensure that security checks are made, to monitor 
                for threats, risks, or vulnerabilities that can affect an organization‚Äôs 
                business continuity and critical assets.

                throughout the course <em>connect and protect network, and network security</em> to analyze a network incident. I also analyzed the 
                situation using the National Institute of Standards and Technology's 
                Cybersecurity Framework (NIST CSF) and create an incident report. The CSF is a 
                voluntary framework that consists of standards, guidelines, and best practices 
                to manage cybersecurity risk.

                I analyzed their current process, identify issues, and make recommendations
                 to improve their security practices.
                access controls are security controls that manage 
                access, authorization, and accountability of information. Authentication 
                controls are used to verify who someone is, whereas authorization controls are 
                used to grant a user permissions and set limits on the things they‚Äôre allowed 
                to do. When done well, access controls are the key to decreasing the 
                likelihood of a security risk.

                business. A vulnerability assessment is the internal review process of an 
                organization‚Äôs security systems. I also evaluate the risks of a vulnerable 
                information system and outline a remediation plan.

            <h2>Importing and parsing a text file in a security-related scenario</h2>
            <p>
                I'm a security professional working at a health care company. As part of my job,
                I was required to regularly update a file that identifies the employees who can access
                restricted content. The contents of the file are based on who is working with personal
                patient records. Employees are restricted access based on their IP address. There is an
                allow list for IP addresses permitted to sign into the restricted subnetwork. There's also
                a remove list that identifies which employees I must remove from this allow list.
                my task is to create an algorithm that uses Python code to check whether the allow list
                contains any IP addresses identified on the remove list. If so, I should remove those
                IP addresses from the file containing the allow list.
